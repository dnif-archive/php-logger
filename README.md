# php-logger

This is the official PHP DNIF client library.
This allows you to directly write log statements into your application code and integrate it with DNIF Adapters.


The DNIF library currently supports two ingestion mechanisms:
1. Uploads using the HTTP(S) endpoint
2. Uploads using the UDP protocol

Typical usages for both of these are provided in the samples directory.
